Hi, I’m Chaitanya 👋

I’m a full-stack engineer with a strong backend foundation and growing experience across data engineering and platform systems. I enjoy building end-to-end applications—from APIs and data pipelines to clean, user-facing interfaces—and deploying them on cloud-native infrastructure.

💻 What I work on:
- Full-stack web applications (backend-first, UI-driven when needed)
- Backend APIs and distributed systems
- Data pipelines and ML-adjacent services
- Cloud infrastructure, CI/CD, and observability

🛠 Tech I use often:
- Backend: Python, Java, FastAPI, Spring Boot
- Frontend: React, TypeScript
- Data: PostgreSQL, Redis, SQL-based analytics
- Cloud: AWS, Azure, Docker

📌 Selected projects:
- MysteryAI – Real-time interactive ML-powered platform
- AI Document Processing Service – Backend pipelines and APIs
- Full-stack dashboards and data-driven web apps (more below)

I like working on systems that connect data, applications, and users in a clean and reliable way.
